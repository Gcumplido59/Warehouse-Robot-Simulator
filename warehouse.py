        """Finds the shortest path from the robot to the package using BFS.

        The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm explores the grid layer by
        layer from the robot's starting position. It guarantees finding the
        shortest path in an unweighted grid by checking all possible paths
        of a certain length before moving on to longer paths.

        The algorithm works as follows:
        1. Initialize a queue with the starting path (containing only the robot's position).
        2. Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles.
        3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the oldest path.
        4. Get the last position from the current path.
        5. If this position is the package's location, the path is found.
        6. Otherwise, explore all valid, unvisited neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        7. For each valid neighbor, create a new path by extending the current path,
           add it to the queue, and mark the neighbor as visited.
        8. If the queue becomes empty and the package has not been reached, no path exists.

        Returns:
            list[tuple[int, int]] or None: A list of (row, col) tuples representing
            the shortest path from the robot to the package. Returns None if no
            path is found.
